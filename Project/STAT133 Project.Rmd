```{r warnings = FALSE}

data1 <- data %>% mutate(movie_title=gsub('\x8c\xe6', '', movie_title)) ##weird symbols cleaned from title

1. Plots of each director and actorâ€™s total gross and median score to find the most popular actors and directors.
```{r}

```

2. Plots showing the review scores and gross of each genre to find the most popular genre.
```{r}

```

3. Plotting the gross revenue against the number of movie facebook likes to see if there is a correlation.
```{r}
mean(data1$budget, na.rm=TRUE)
```

4. Plotting the budget against gross in popular American movies to see if there is a correlation.

3807 USA movies.
```{r warnings=FALSE}
return_on_budget <- data1 %>%
  filter(country == 'USA') 
nrow(return_on_budget)

return_on_budget_plot <- return_on_budget %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=budget/100000000, y=gross/100000000)) %>%
  + geom_point(aes(color=imdb_score), alpha= 0.3) %>%
  + geom_smooth(method=loess) %>%
  + labs(title='Budget Efficiency', x="Budget (00,000,000)", y="Gross Revenue (00,000,000)", color = "Score") %>%
  + theme_igray() %>%
  + theme(legend.key.size = unit(.3, "cm"))
return_on_budget_plot
lm(gross ~ budget, return_on_budget)
```
Talk about the IMDB score compared to budget/gross.

From the linear regression, the slight positive relationship between money spent on production and gross revenue is apparent. 

Since 72.7551% of popular American movies are within an a $100,000,000 budget and $200,000,000 gross revenue, let's examine those cases to see if the correlation still holds true.
```{r warnings=FALSE}
return_on_budget_x1_y2 <- return_on_budget %>%
  filter(budget < 100000000, gross < 200000000)

nrow(return_on_budget_x1_y2)/nrow(return_on_budget)

return_on_budget_plot_x1_y2 <- return_on_budget %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=budget/100000000, y=gross/100000000)) %>%
  + geom_point(aes(color=imdb_score), alpha= 0.3) %>%
  + geom_smooth(method=loess) %>%
  + labs(title='Budget Efficiency', x="Budget (00,000,000)", y="Gross Revenue (00,000,000)", color = "Score") %>%
  + theme_igray() %>%
  + theme(legend.key.size = unit(.3, "cm")) %>%
  + xlim(0,1) + ylim(0,2)
return_on_budget_plot_x1_y2
lm(gross ~ budget, return_on_budget_x1_y2)

```
There is still a positive, linear correlation between budget spent and gross revenue. 
The question now is whether larger budgets is equivalent to a larger relative revenues. 
```{r}
summary(data1$gross)
summary(data1$budget)

data2 <- data1 %>% mutate(budget_efficiency = gross/budget)

above_average_budgets <- data2 %>% ##Number of Budgets above average
  filter(budget > 39750000) %>%
  tally()
efficient_above_average_budgets <- data2 %>% ##if budget above average, what is the number of movies that made money
  filter(budget > 39750000, budget_efficiency > 1) %>%
  tally()

below_average_budgets <- data2 %>% ##Number of Budgets Below average
  filter(budget < 39750000) %>%
  tally()
efficient_below_average_budgets <- data2 %>% ##if budget below average, what is the number of movies that made money
  filter(budget < 39750000, budget_efficiency > 1) %>%
  tally()
```

```{r}
efficient_above_average_budgets/above_average_budgets
efficient_below_average_budgets/below_average_budgets
```
As seen in the calculations, the percentage of above average budget movies actually earning back their budget (47.77948%) is higher than the percentage of below average budget movies earning back their budget (43.94453%). Based upon this dataset, popular American movies appear to perform well at the box office if their budget is above the average budget spent on making American movies. 

5. Plotting the content rating against the gross revenue to see which content rated movies are the most successful in terms of revenue. 
```{r}

```


6. Visualizing what are the most popular keywords in the plot keywords.
```{r}

```
